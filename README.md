# Vision-based Navigation and Object Detection at Low Frame Rates

This project aims to simulate the movement of a robot to navigate around obstacles and search for a target object.
The image dataset for the robot simulation can be found in the link below, courtesy of Phil Ammirato, Patrick Poirson, Eunbyung Park, Jana Kosecka, and Alexander C. Berg: https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ammirato/active_vision_dataset_website/index.html

To run the simulation, download the datasets from the link and run final.py
~/python final.py target_colour target_shape
